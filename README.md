The data for the web page is in [samples.json](https://github.com/Hala-INTJ/Belly-Button-Demographics-Panel/blob/main/samples.json), the web application logic is in [charts.js](https://github.com/Hala-INTJ/Belly-Button-Demographics-Panel/blob/main/charts.js) and the structure of the webpage is in [index.html](https://github.com/Hala-INTJ/Belly-Button-Demographics-Panel/blob/main/index.html). The [styles.css](https://github.com/Hala-INTJ/Belly-Button-Demographics-Panel/blob/main/styles.css) is used to format part of the contents of the webpage.
